Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(3):553–562, 2005. A Properties of the Utility Ratio To compare the efficacy of the constraints across different distributions, we would like RD(L, β) to take similar values for different choices of D. Recall that we focus on distributions with a non-negative support. Clearly, for these RD(L, β) lies between 0 and 1. This is because he x, wi is always non-negative, and it is at most hx? , wi. However, it is possible that its range, while a subset of [0, 1], changes significantly between distributions. The next proposition shows that this is not true. Proposition A.1 (Invariance of range). For all continuous distributions D and implicit bias parameters β1, . . . βp ∈ (0, 1], absent any constraints (i.e., L = 0), the range of RD(L, β) is \x10 Ev∼D[v] sup(supp(D)) , 1 i . As a special case, the above proposition shows that the range of the utility ratio is invariant across all distributions with the same mean and support. Its proof is straightforward, and appears in Supplementary Material A.1. Second, we have the following property. Proposition A.2 (Invariance to scaling). Suppose D0 is a scaled version of D.6 For all implicit bias parameters β1, . . . βp ∈ (0, 1] and constraints L, RD(L, β) = RD0 (L, β). Proposition A.2 shows that the utility ratio, RD(L, β) is invariant to scaling of the distribution. Its proof is']
